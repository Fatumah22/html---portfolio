<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fatumah. I am a senior in high school. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and
  that I like to study. My favorite subjects are chemistry and biology. I am going to enter the 
  university because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected professional
  in one of the fields..</p>

<p>I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, 
  I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
  I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. 
  The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive
  and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine</p>

<p>My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet
  new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is 
  one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting
  things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me</p>
